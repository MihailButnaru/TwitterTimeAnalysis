<h4 align="center">Twitter Analysis.</h4>



## Information
This project was developed in order to analyse the tweets that were posted each hour (24 hours) during the 2016 Olympic Games. The 2016 Olympic games were in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and the time zone difference is -3 hours(Summer) because Olympic game started on 5 August 2016.

In order to develop this project was used Big Data techniques, Mapper and Reducer. The mapper counts how many tweets were posted every hour and the input was split by a semicolon to separate the fields of the tweet.
The reducer was used to combine the results of the mapper. The hour of the tweet is the key and the list of values is the number of times a tweet was posted on that hour.
